Don't try formulate emails for repeated queries, copy paste and input correct customer details.
If you do have to formulate one be precise and to the point, avoid compositions. Save product
knowledge notes on sticky notes for easy and quick reference, if the query will take long to
inquire offer call back than hold the customer.

Dealing with angry customers: 5 steps for call center agents
Try the steps below to improve the situation with the customer
Step 1: Listen.
Let the caller vent his frustration. Sometimes, after a caller is given the chance to express
displeasure, they will apologize and allow you to solve the problem with no further anger.
Take notes while you listen.
Step 2: Remain calm.
Use an even tone while you speak. Remember that the customer isn’t angry at you. Put yourself
in their shoes.
Step 3: Repeat information.
Make them feel as if you are on their side. Apologize about the problem, convey empathy and
then summarize their main points.
Step 4: Avoid the hold button.
Hold time will add to the caller’s frustration, escalating the situation.
Step 5: Make the caller happy.
Be sure to not only tell your customer what their options are, but also how soon each option can
be implemented.
Ask the caller if there is anything else you can help them with.

How to Handle an Escalated Customer Confrontation
Step 1: Let go of your ego
It’s critical that you maintain a certain emotional distance during the interaction. Don’t let your
ego enter the equation. Otherwise, the conflict will become personal — and you don’t want that.
Make a conscious effort to control your responses. Manage them carefully. Be cautious with
your words and tone, as well as with your body language. In this way, you can ensure you behave
with the utmost professionalism.

Step 2: Decide to defuse
Manage the conversation cadence. If the customer is shouting, speak softly. If he is talking very
quickly, speak slowly.
Ask for and use the customer’s name and introduce yourself by name.
Ask the customer to explain what happened so you know the real problem. Actively listen.
Agree that there is a problem. Don’t defend, deny, or explain why the problem happened — it’ll
just sound like you’re making excuses. Besides, those are all offstage issues that the customer
doesn’t really care about.

Apologize . . . several times, if need be.
Tell the customer that you’re going to act immediately to fix the problem.

Step 3: Understand the problem
Avoid these three common errors:
Focusing on the facts: understanding a problem is as much about understanding and
acknowledging the emotions that have resulted from the problem as it is about understanding
the cold, hard facts of the situation,
Assuming your view of the situation is correct: You must at least consider the possibility that the
customer’s view is, in fact, the correct one.
Playing the blame game: Apologize, take ownership of the problem, and then move to
understand the real issues.
Step 4: Allow time for venting
Let the customer speak. Give him a chance to vent — that is, to safely discharge his anger
and/or frustration. Don’t rush him, and don’t jump in to defend yourself. Be patient.
Step 5: Get to common ground
Most major negotiations are merely a series of small sub-agreements and even smaller yeses.
When interacting with an incensed customer — or when engaged in any high-stakes
conversation — your job is to listen for any small “yes” that can move the conversation forward.
The idea is to quickly reach some small agreements.

Silent Connection & Customer Distracted
A silent call is a telephone call in which the calling party does not speak when the call is
answered. In some instances it could be the network or handset.
A distracted customer is the one whose attention is diverted or drawn away, you can hear them
but they are busy doing other things. In most instances its very difficult to get their attention.

How Zipit Smart works
The service will enable any merchant or person with a ZIPIT-enabled bank account to receive
merchant payments. The Merchants will not issue out their bank accounts (which are usually
long and inconvenient for customers to enter) to the customers but rather they have created
shorter Merchant codes that are linked to the respective Merchant’s bank account. Primary
target market are the SMSEs who we not afford to buy or get traditional bank POS machines.
Customers will be able to make merchant payments using their mobile phones, both from their
respective banks’ USSD or mobile app. The Merchant Payments through ZIPIT Smart are not
going to be subjected to the ZWL $5,000 which mobile money wallets are currently being
subjected to. The reason is because the customer will be

How To Handle Repeat Callers
How To Handle Repeat Callers provides a structured approach for customer service
representatives to manage repeat calls from customers who are experiencing unresolved
issues. Here's a summary of the key steps outlined:
1. Acknowledge Receipt of Complaint: Thank the customer for bringing the issue to your
attention. Offer a sincere apology. Maintain a positive and helpful tone.
2. Confirm the Repeat Query: Verify if the agreed turnaround time has passed. Take full
responsibility for the issue. Treat the issue with urgency.
3. Investigate the Complaint: Check the status of the query on TT (likely a ticketing
system) and email. Follow up with the responsible person via a voice call. Send a followup email for record-keeping. Keep the customer updated frequently.
4. Escalate the Query: If the issue involves higher offices, engage the shift leader and
team leader. Follow up the escalation process with an email for record-keeping. Update
the customer once the issue is resolved and thank them for their patience.

This approach emphasizes the importance of communication, responsibility, and urgency in
resolving customer issues effectively.

What Is Follow Up?
Customer Follow-up is the process of completing an activity. In this case, it involves giving the
customer feedback concerning their query, which is either resolved or still a work in progress.
Query Follow-up is the process of engaging the Helpdesk via email or by reopening a ticket in
connection with a "perceived" unresolved query.
•

For such queries – Qualify them under Ticket_COMP_Perceived_Resolved on
AVAYA.

•

DON’T – Follow up on a freshly logged query. Give the Helpdesk time to investigate,
solve, resolve, and revert within SLA (e.g., following up with HD 9 minutes after logging a
query).

Only Follow Up When:
1.

The query has been resolved, and you promised to call the customer back.

2.

The technician requires additional information or asks you to relay information and
revert with an update. Example:"...Kindly advise the customer to restart." "...Kindly note
the bundle has been used." "...Kindly confirm batch and serial numbers."

3.

The ticket nature requires you to automatically make a follow-up. Example: Selfcare
Overscratched cards.

Hacked Line
Hacking is the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer or mobile device.
If someone steals your phone number, they become you — for all intents and purposes. With
your phone number, a hacker can start hijacking your accounts one by one by having a
password reset sent to your phone. They can trick you and trick automated systems — like your
bank — into thinking they're you when you call customer service. Phone hacking can range from
stealing personal details to listening in on phone conversations. There are several ways
someone can hack a phone, including using phishing attacks, tracking software, and unsecured
Wi-Fi networks.

How to Know if A SIM Card Has Been Hacked?
• Radio Silence: A SIM card has likely been compromised if the customer ceases getting calls
and messages. By asking someone to give them a call or text, they may verify this. In the event
that they do, their SIM card is secure.
• Incorrect Location History: Visit websites offering "Find my device" or "Locate my device"
services. Your SIM has likely been hacked if you see a different location than the one you are in.
• Access Denied. If you cannot access your social media, bank accounts, your SIM may have
been hacked.

QUESTIONS TO ASK

1. What makes you think you got hacked?
2. Apart from you, who else uses or has had access to your device?
3. Did you replace your line/ was your line replaced recently? (check on CVBS if there was a
duplicate sim under Order Information, if no replacement was done and they can still make and
receive calls with their line then rule out sim replacement)
4. Did you receive any messages via email, SMS or WhatsApp that prompted or requested for
you to give your pin?
5. Do you use WhatsApp web? (advise them to go on Linked Devices to check if any devices are
linked and if so, advise them to log out. If the customer still
thinks that their WhatsApp was hacked, they should contact WhatsApp support and or try and
use a very basic handset (mbudzi) and monitor if their line voice, sms, WhatsApp and location
activity is still being accessed)
6. If the customer mentions call history, ask them if they registered on mywebselfcare (this
shows call history can be accessed if the customer was registered without their knowledge.
Also check to see if the customer’s line registered on my webselfcare on the system. If
registered, with the customer’s consent you can remove the webselfcare and advise the
customer to re-register with new security questions)

How to Prevent SIM Hacking, Swapping or Cloning
1. Look Before You Click- Do not click on any links unless you are 100% sure of their origin. Do
not open any links you receive on email or text they could be phishing attacks. Do not install any
unnecessary apps. Hackers often lure people by promising rewards or discount codes. These
apps could contain cloning software or other malware. Always remember, there’s no such thing
as a free lunch!
2. Avoid Oversharing- Avoid sharing too much personal information online. There are new kinds
of hacks coming to light every day. The more accessible you are, the more vulnerable you get.
SIM swapping requires hackers to obtain personal information about you in order to
impersonate you. There is no point in making their job easy by serving up every detail of your life
to them online.
3. Put a PIN in It - Most cellular networks now give you the option to set up a password or PIN in
addition to two-factor authentication. We know that nobody wants to remember yet another PIN
or password. But adding this small step of security could save you a lot of hassle later.
WhatsApp 2-Step Verification - Tap Account > Two-step verification > Enable. Enter a six-digit
PIN of your choice and confirm it. Provide an email address you can access or tap Skip if you
don't want to add an email address. We recommend adding an email address as this allows you
to reset two-step verification and helps safeguard your WhatsApp account.
4. Update all your Apps/ Encrypt Everything- Facebook, WhatsApp, Tik Tok etc. WhatsApp offers
a lot more protection than apps that don’t use end-to-end encryption by default. Every piece of
technology you use—from the Facebook app on your phone to the operating system that

controls your smart lightbulb—is open to attack. That’s why it’s crucial you download and
update the latest versions of the apps and software you’re using.
5. Remove Your Number/ Wipe Your Digital Footprint- Not every account needs your phone
number. Remove your phone number wherever possible.
6. Keep Your Serial Number Safe- Your serial number is linked to your SIM card and your IMEI
number is linked to your phone itself. Hackers can use these numbers if they find them out so
keep them safe.
7. Keep Your Phone Close- SIM cloning requires physical access to your SIM card. Protection
against that is fairly easy so don’t leave your phone unattended. Having said that, we cannot
always ensure total protection. Your phone might get lost or stolen, which means your SIM card
could end up anywhere – along with all your sensitive data.

In the event that you advise the customer to do a Factory Resetplease make it crystal clear to
the customer that;
• You will lose everything you have on your phone, after a factory reset.
• A factory reset basically means restoring the phone to an unboxed condition. Your phone will
become the same it was when it was first switched on, you will have to sign in again on your
device. (customer must do so at own risk knowing that the info will not be recovered unless they
backed up the files, pictures and any other info somewhere)

Hacked Line | What To do & Escalation
Voice_Comp_Hacked Line (for voice calls, sms)
Data_Comp_Hacked Line(for WhatsApp, emails, mywebselfcare)
Before escalating to Commercial Investigations – Ensure that you troubleshoot and provide
detailed information on the issue around hacking. Do Not Escalate Vague queries.
• Most queries that are being escalated under Hacked Line do not require escalation, but a
matter of customer education and advising them to make police reports.
• For any cases reported to the Police – there is a process already in place on how the police can
be assisted. (Risk Department will assist the Investigating Officer with relevant information
where applicable)

Smart4U FAQS
1. What is the Fair Usage Policy (FUP) for the Unlimited Bundles, and how does it impact
customers' usage?

Answer: FUPs are tailored to each customer based on their usage history from previous months
and are increased by a generous factor to give our customers more value.

2. Could you clarify why the bundles are referred to as "unlimited" when they are actually
subject to limits?
Answer: Please note that there are not unlimited but they have Fair Usage Policy. “Unlimited”
was a trial name which has now been superseded by Smart4You which better expresses the
Intelligent customization of each bundle for every customer.

4. How long is the offer message valid for, and what happens if a customer fails to respond
within the specified timeframe?
Answer: The offer message is valid for 30 days. They must go to *143# and select option 7 which
will be labelled Smart4You (S4U) to purchase the bundle.

5. What criteria do you use to determine which customers are eligible to receive offer messages
for the Unlimited Bundles?
Answer: Customers enjoying the trial period were selected randomly and the intention is add
more and more customers until all customers has a S4U (Unlimited) offer.

6. We have received feedback suggesting that the internet speeds for the Unlimited Bundles are
slower than those for other bundles. Could you provide insight into the expected internet
speeds for the Unlimited Bundles?
Answer: They have the speeds as the other bundles. The primary component offers unlimited
speeds until a certain data threshold is reached. After that, speeds will be throttled for the
remainder of the bundle.

7. How can customers check their balance for the Unlimited Bundles?
Answer: On data data component, they will not be able to do so. For Voice and SMS portion,
they can check through *143# option.

8. If a customer experiences issues with receiving an offer message, what is the process for
requesting another message?

Answer: If a customer does not receive the offer message, it means they are not eligible at that
time.

9. Are there any data speed throttling or limitations on the Unlimited Bundles?
Answer: Yes, Once the customer exceeds a certain threshold of data usage within a billing cycle,
their connection speed may be reduced (throttled). It is meant to ensure efficient and equitable
use of available network resources so that each customer can
enjoy the best possible experience without compromising that experience of neighbouring
customers sharing the same network resources.

10. Can I share(Transfer) my Unlimited Bundle with friends?
Answer: Smart4You (Unlimited) bundles are not transferable because the recipient’s usage
profile would differ from that of the one sharing the data.

11. Why am I no longer getting the offer for unlimited data from 289 and why is the option not
appearing when I dial *143# on my phone, is there anything I did wrong?
Answer: Please note that offers are sent once in a month. The option will disappear on *143#
once you purchase the bundle and will appear once 30 days have lapsed.

the same value. This allows the customer to switch the usage of their bundled allowance from
data services to voice calling services. Bundle conversions can be qualified on Talkdesk as
follows: Data_REQ_ARTME SocialBun-Voice (Conversion to voice airtime)
Data_REQ_ARTME_Whtsapp To FB - (Conversion from WhatsApp to FB or vice versa)
Query escalation Social Bundle Conversion:
CSR should escalate a bundle conversion query to the helpdesk for second-level support.

Omni_DATA_REQ_ARTME SocialBun-Voice (Log any social bundle that needs to be converted
to Voice airtime)

Omni_DATA_REQ_ARTME_Whtsapp To FB (Only log WhatsApp Bundles that need to be
converted into Facebook bundles and Vice Versa (Facebook to WhatsApp)
Before escalating the CSR should check the following:
The bundle is still intact and has not been partially used (CSR should make use of Online
CDRs, which give detailed consumption history).
The bundle has not yet expired.
The bundle has not yet been depleted.
Before escalating the query, the CSR should recommend/advise the customer to switch off their
data connection to ensure that the bundle is not used before the conversion.
Follow-up
Follow up when:
The query has been resolved and you promised to call the customer back.
The technician requires additional information or requires you to relay information and revert
with an update
The technician's response shows that the bundle has been depleted or partially used.
